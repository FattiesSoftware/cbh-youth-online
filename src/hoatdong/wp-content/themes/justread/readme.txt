== Description ==

Justread is a perfect choice for people who want a fast and clean website. Focusing on the layout and typography, we want to deliver a good reading experience to our WordPress users.

Built on the latest technology of WordPress, Justread is lightweight, fast and optimized for all mobile phones.

== Installation ==
In order to make the theme works properly, you need to install the Recommended plugins first. Simply go to the Dashboard -> Justread -> Implement Recommended Actions. Then click on Install the Recommended plugins.

After installing Recommended plugins, which includes Jetpack, you need to connect to WordPress.com to use it (it requires you to create an account on wordpress.com – which is free). If you don’t want to create an account on wordpress.com, you can enable the Jetpack development mode.

Finally, go to Dashboard -> Appearance -> Import Demo Data to make your website exactly the same as our demo.
